# Predicting-Food-Prices-in-PH-using-LightGBM
### Creating a LightGBM model to predict prices of variations of foods in the Philippines. The predicing factors that was used in this machine learning are the food type, food name, and its market location while I use the proce as the redicting factor of the machine.
### The database that was used came from World Food Programme (updated as of November 2021.)
### This project's significance lies more in the food industry as they will have a more objective way to predict the price of a certain foods so that they will have a more efficient way in making varous desicions such as food planning, food inventory, among others.
### This was my first project in implementing my knowledge in machine learning and this was supposed to be our final requirement in a course but the prject was ulimately canceled so I am uploading this here for the reference.
